# ITP-380-Projects
This is a collection of projects completed for the course ITP 380: Video Game Programming at USC.  In this course, I have re-created many classic games using C++ and assets provided by the class.

Pong For One
This project recreates the classic arcade tennis game Pong(1972), but as o single player gaem instead.  The player controls a rectangular paddle and bounces the ball against the wall.  The goal is to keep the ball from moving past your paddle.

I calculated delte time to limit the game to 60 frames-per-second (FPS) and I implemented the movement of both the paddle and the ball.  I included an additional feature where the player can "rewind time" and have the ball travel backwards along its trajectory by holding down the "R" key.
